# CS_7650
On this Github we have the scripts used for computing the metric evaluators for all LLM responses compared to the golden answers, code for querying all LLMs and code for fine tuning our own LLM.

We have all our data collected/scraped (Pdfs and Json files for all 5 states) linked here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gWu9ATzaXscY9YJYBkw-GC9vCTwjruE1?usp=sharing

Here is the link to our 1000 LLM query and answer pairs, as well as the responses for all of our LLMs which were evaluated for the benchmark: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10298CsFMCUz7-ZnxsgQhZncI5DusRfj1aoNM2LN753M/edit?usp=sharing
