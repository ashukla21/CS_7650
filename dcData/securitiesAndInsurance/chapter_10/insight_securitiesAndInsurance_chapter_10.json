For purposes of this chapter, a material acquisition (or the aggregate of any series of related acquisitions during any 30-day period) or disposition (or the aggregate of any series of related dispositions during any 30-day period) is one that is nonrecurring and not in the ordinary course of business and involves more than 5% of the reporting insurer\u2019s total admitted assets as reported in its most recent statutory statement filed with the insurance department of the insurer\u2019s state of domicile. (b) (1) Asset acquisitions subject to this chapter include every purchase, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, succession, or other acquisition other than the construction or development of real property by or for the reporting insurer or the acquisition of materials for such purpose. (2) Asset dispositions subject to this chapter include every sale, lease, exchange, merger, consolidation, mortgage, hypothecation, assignment (whether for the benefit of creditors or otherwise), abandonment, destruction, or other disposition.

An insurer is deemed to have ceded substantially all of its direct and assumed business to a pool if: (1) The insurer has less than $1,000,000 total direct plus assumed written premiums during a calendar year that are not subject to a pooling arrangement; and (2) The net income of the business not subject to the pooling arrangement represents less than 5% of the insurer\u2019s capital and surplus.
