(b) Not less than 10 days written notice shall be mailed to the insured of the intent of the premium finance company to cancel the insurance contract unless the default is cured within such 10-day period. (c) After expiration of such 10-day period, the premium finance company may thereafter request, in the name of the insured, cancellation of such insurance contract or contracts by mailing to the insurer a notice of cancellation, and the insurance contract shall be canceled as if such notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured himself, but without requiring the return of the insurance contract or contracts.

(f) In the event that the crediting of return premiums to the account of the insured results in a surplus over the amount due from the insured, the premium finance company shall refund such excess to the insured provided that no such refund shall be required if it amounts to less than $1. (g) When a default results in the cancellation of an insurance contract listed in the premium finance agreement, the premium finance agreement may provide for the payment by the insured of a cancellation charge equal to the difference between any delinquent charge imposed in respect of the installment or installments in default and $10; provided, however, that should the cancellation notice be withdrawn prior to its effective date and the insurance coverage reinstated, the agreement may provide for payment by the insured of a reinstatement charge equal to the cancellation charge herein provided.
