(c) An international banking corporation may from time to time change the address of its registered office and shall change its registered agent if the office of the registered agent becomes vacant for any reason, if its registered agent becomes disqualified or incapacitated to act, or if it revokes the appointment of its registered agent. A change of registered office or registered agent may be effected by filing with the Commissioner duplicate originals of a statement setting forth the details with respect to the change and the effective date thereof. (d) Service of process in a suit, action, or proceeding, or service of a notice or demand required or permitted by law to be served on an international banking corporation, may be made on a licensed international banking corporation by serving the registered agent of the international banking corporation. If a licensed international banking corporation fails to appoint or maintain a registered agent upon whom legal process or a notice or demand may be served, the registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be found at the registered office of the international banking corporation, or the license of an international banking corporation is revoked, the Commissioner shall be irrevocably authorized as the agent and representative of the international banking corporation to accept service of process or a notice or demand required or permitted by law to be served on the international banking corporation. Service on the Commissioner of any process, notice, or demand for the international banking corporation shall be made by delivering to and leaving with the Commissioner, or with any official having charge of the Department, duplicate copies of the process, notice, or demand. If any process, notice, or demand is served on the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall immediately forward a copy by registered mail to the international banking corporation at its principal office as the same appears on the Department\u2019s records. Nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the right to serve any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served upon a foreign corporation in any other manner now or hereafter permitted by law. The Commissioner shall keep a record of all process, notices, and demands served upon the Commissioner under this section, setting forth the time of service and the Commissioner\u2019s action on the service.

The Commissioner may from time to time require that the assets deposited under this subsection be maintained by the international banking corporation in such amount, and in such form and subject to such conditions as the Commissioner considers necessary or desirable for the maintenance of a sound financial condition, the protection of depositors and the public interest, and the confidence in the business of each branch or agency. (b) An international banking corporation shall hold in the District of Columbia currency or such other assets as the Commissioner shall, by regulation, permit, in an amount which shall be a percentage, determined by the Commissioner by order or regulation, of the liabilities of the international banking corporation.

If, by reason of the existence or potential occurrence of unusual and extraordinary circumstances, the Commissioner considers it necessary or desirable for the maintenance of a sound financial condition, the protection of depositors, creditors, and the public interest, and to maintain public confidence in the business of an international agency or international branch of an international banking corporation in the District of Columbia, the Commissioner may, subject to such terms and conditions as the Commissioner may prescribe, require the international banking corporation to deposit the assets required to be held in the District of Columbia under this subsection with such banks as the Commissioner may designate.

The dollar equivalent of this amount, as determined by the Commissioner, shall be considered to be the amount of its capital, surplus, and undivided profits. (b) (1) The Commissioner shall, by regulation, prescribe the limits of drafts or bills of exchange which an international agency or branch may accept relative to the capital account of the international banking corporation. The limits shall take into account all transactions which are included and excluded in computing the lending limit for acceptances of a federal international bank office. (2) Except to the extent they are inconsistent with this chapter, the provisions of the District of Columbia Banking Code shall apply to the loans and investments made by an international bank agency or international branch of the international banking corporation. With respect to an international banking corporation and its international bank agencies or international branches, a reference in those provisions to capital, capital account, or similar terms shall refer to the capital account of the international banking corporation, and, except when used with reference to the capital account, a reference in those provisions to the term \u201cbank\u201d shall refer to the international agencies and branches of the international banking corporation which are licensed in the District of Columbia. (3) Any limitation in this chapter based on the capital account of an international banking corporation shall refer, with respect to an international agency or international branch in the District of Columbia, to the dollar equivalent of the capital account of the international banking corporation, as determined by the Commissioner. If the international banking corporation has more than one international agency or international branch in the District of Columbia, the business transacted by all agencies or branches shall be aggregated in determining compliance with a limitation or restriction.

(f) An international banking corporation that maintains a representative office in the District of Columbia licensed under this chapter shall make, maintain, and preserve at the office or at such other place as determined by the Commissioner, such books, accounts, and other records relating to the activities conducted at the office as the Commissioner may require.
